title: "About Me"
---



<p>I love a good story. This is what first attracted me to statistics in my undergrad days—the way it wove through data and numbers and made stories out of them. You can ask questions like what happened here? What will happen now? There are clichés where you are pretty sure where the story is going, and other times, there is a plot twist.</p>
<p>My passion for the life sciences made merging these fields a no-brainer. Completing my master’s in Diagnostics and Precision Medicine reinforced my belief that through statistical modeling, bioinformatics, and computational analysis, I contribute to better decisions and push science forward—in clinical trials and health market research.</p>
<p>If you also enjoy stories and/or numbers, come join me in unraveling the mysteries hidden in data.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Tope</p>
